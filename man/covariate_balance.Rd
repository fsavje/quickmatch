\usage{
covariate_balance(
  treatments,
  covariates,
  matching = NULL,
  target = NULL,
  normalize = TRUE,
  all_differences = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{treatments}{factor specifying the units' treatment assignments.}

\item{covariates}{vector, matrix or data frame with covariates to derive balance for.}

\item{matching}{\code{\link{qm_matching}} or \code{\link[scclust]{scclust}} object with
the matched groups. If \code{NULL}, balance is derived for the unmatched
sample.}

\item{target}{units to target the balance measures for. If \code{NULL}, the measures will
be the raw average over all units in the sample (i.e., ATE). A non-null
value specifies a subset of units to derive balance measures for (e.g.,
ATT or ATC). If \code{target} is a logical vector with the same length as
the sample size, units indicated with \code{TRUE} will be targeted. If
\code{target} is an integer vector, the units with indices in \code{target}
are targeted. If \code{target} is a character vector, it should contain
treatment labels, and the corresponding units (as given by
\code{treatments}) will be targeted. If \code{matching} is \code{NULL},
\code{target} is ignored.}

\item{normalize}{logical scalar indicating whether differences should be normalized by the
sample standard deviation of the corresponding covariates.}

\item{all_differences}{logical scalar indicating whether full matrices of differences should be
reported. If \code{FALSE}, only the maximum difference for each covariate
is returned.}
}
\value{
Returns the mean difference between treatment groups in the matched sample
   for each covariate.

   When \code{all_differences = TRUE}, the function returns a matrix for each
   covariate with the mean difference for each possible pair of treatment
   conditions. Rows in the matrices indicate minuends in the differences and
   columns indicate subtrahends. For example, when differences are normalized,
   the matrix:
   \tabular{rrrr}{
     \tab a \tab b \tab c\cr
     a \tab 0.0 \tab 0.3 \tab 0.5\cr
     b \tab -0.3 \tab 0.0 \tab 0.2\cr
     c \tab -0.5 \tab -0.2 \tab 0.0\cr
   }
   reports that the mean difference for the corresponding covariate between
   treatments "a" and "b" is 30\% of a sample standard deviation of the covariate.
   The maximum difference (in absolute value) is also reported in a separate vector.
   For example, the maximum difference for the covariate in the example above is 0.5.

   When \code{all_differences = FALSE}, only the maximum differences are
   reported.

\description{
\code{covariate_balance} derives measures of covariate balance between
treatment groups in matched samples. The function calculates normalized mean
differences between all pairs of treatment conditions for each covariate.
}
\details{
\code{covariate_balance} calculates covariate balance by first deriving the
(normalized) mean difference between all treatment conditions for each
covariate in each matched group. It then aggregates the differences by a
weighted average, where the \code{target} parameter decides the weights.
When the average treatment effect (ATE) is of interest (i.e.,
\code{target == NULL}), the matched groups will be weighted by their sizes.
When \code{target} indicates that some subset of units is of interest, the
number of such units in each matched group will decide its weight. For
example, if we are interested in the average treatment effect of the treated
(ATT), the weight of a group will be proportional to the number of treated
units in that group. The reweighting of the groups captures that we are
prepared to accept greater imbalances in groups with few units of interest.

By default, the differences are normalized by the sample standard deviation
of the corresponding covariate (see the \code{normalize} parameter). In more
detail, the sample variance of the covariate is derived separately for each
treatment group. The square root of the mean of these variances is then used
for the normalization. The matching is ignored when deriving the normalization
factor so that balance can be compared across different matchings or with
the unmatched sample.

\code{covariate_balance} focuses on mean differences, but higher moments and
interactions can be investigated by adding corresponding columns to the
covariate matrix (see examples below).
